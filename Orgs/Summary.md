# Organization Mod - Summary Document

## Design Document

### Overview

The Organization Mod for Crusader Kings 3 is designed to expand and deepen the role of organizations within the game world, introducing a plethora of unique mechanics, events, and intricate relationships. Characters can now belong to multiple organizations, each with their own distinct attributes, roles, and interactions.

### Core Mechanics of an Organization

1. **Hierarchy and Rank System**: The mod introduces a systematic hierarchy in every organization. Each member holds a certain rank that directly impacts their influence, decision-making power, responsibilities, and standing within the organization. A dynamic progression system allows characters to climb the ranks through merits, quests, personal influence, or other means defined by the organization.

2. **Power Dynamics**: Power within an organization is not merely defined by rank but also through personal influence, alliances, and rivalries. The mod introduces intricate power dynamics, where members can leverage alliances, engage in intrigues, or exploit the organization's rules to gain power.

3. **Tasks and Quests**: Depending on the rank and the influence a member holds within the organization, various tasks and quests are assigned. These tasks may directly relate to the organization's goals, reflect the internal power dynamics, or even revolve around the larger game world's context. 

4. **Organizational Resources**: Each organization has specific resources at its disposal, such as wealth, information, manpower, or even magical artifacts. The management, distribution, and utilization of these resources play a significant role in the organization's health and influence in the game world.

5. **Membership and Recruitment**: Membership in an organization is based on specific criteria. This could range from bloodline and lineage, proving oneself through a quest, or simply buying one's way into the organization. Recruitment is an active process where characters can be approached based on their abilities, reputation, or even their potential usefulness to the organization's goals.

6. **Organizational Goals and Objectives**: Each organization has a specific set of goals and objectives that guide its operations, activities, and tasks assigned to its members. The mod allows for these goals to be dynamic, responding to the changing circumstances of the game world and the organization's internal power dynamics.

### Organization Archetypes

The mod categorizes organizations into several archetypes. Each archetype comes with its unique attributes, goals, mechanics, and internal structures. The archetypes are:

1. **Governmental Organizations**
2. **Religious Organizations**
3. **Martial/Military Organizations**
4. **Economic Organizations**
5. **Scholastic/Educational Organizations**
6. **Espionage Organizations**
7. **Social/Recreational Organizations**
