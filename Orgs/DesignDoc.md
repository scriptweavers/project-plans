# Design Document for Crusader Kings 3 Organization Mod

## 1. Overview
This mod expands the concept of organizations within Crusader Kings 3. It introduces a robust system of primary organizations, sub-organizations, and secret societies, each with their own rules, roles, and mechanics. The mod aims to add depth and nuance to gameplay, offering new avenues for intrigue, roleplay, and strategic decision-making.

## 2. Gameplay Mechanics

### 2.1 Core Features
- **Primary and Sub-Organizations**: The mod will allow each primary organization to have multiple sub-organizations. For example, a Kingdom (primary organization) could have various Ducal Factions (sub-organizations) within it.

- **Secret Organizations**: Certain organizations, both primary and sub, could be secret societies. Members of these organizations would operate covertly, with their own unique missions and mechanics.

- **Visibility and Discovery**: The mod will add mechanics to control the visibility and discovery of secret organizations. Increased activities of secret organizations will raise suspicion and increase their chances of discovery.

- **Player Interaction**: Players can interact with, join, or even create these organizations, offering new gameplay options.

### 2.2 Organization Types
The mod will support multiple organization types:

- Governmental Organizations (Kingdoms, Republics, Theocracies, Oligarchies, Merchant Republics)
- Religious Organizations (Churches, Temples, Monastic Orders, Heretic Cults, Pagan Covens)
- Martial/Military Organizations (Armies, Mercenary Bands, Knightly Orders, Elite Guard Units)
- Economic Organizations (Trade Blocs, Merchant Consortiums)
- Scholastic/Educational Organizations (Universities, Libraries, Alchemist Guilds, Philosopher Societies)
- Espionage Organizations (Spy Networks, Assassin Guilds, Secret Police)
- Social/Recreational Organizations (Artistic Guilds, Theatrical Troupes, Social Clubs)

### 2.3 Sub-Organizations & Secret Societies
Sub-organizations and secret societies will have their own internal hierarchy, rules, and roles. They will interact with the level above and below them. For example, a secret society of assassins might influence a Kingdom's politics, while its members might also have public roles as knights or courtiers.

## 3. User Interface Design
The mod will introduce new UI elements to represent the new organizations. For example, a new tab might be added to character profiles for organization membership, and a new map mode might display the influence of various organizations.

## 4. Art and Sound Design
The mod will require new art assets for the UI elements. We'll also need new icons to represent different organization types, membership status, and secret society activities. If possible, we could also introduce new sound effects for organization-related events.

## 5. Storylines and Events
The mod will introduce new storylines and events related to the organizations. For example, a character might be invited to join a secret society, or a Kingdom might experience a crisis due to the machinations of a sub-organization.

## 6. Compatibility
The mod will be designed to be compatible with the base game of Crusader Kings 3. It will also be designed with compatibility with other mods in mind, ensuring it doesn't conflict with commonly used mods.

## 7. Extensibility
The mod will be designed with extensibility in mind. Other modders could create 'flavor mods' that build upon the base organization system. For example, a modder could create a "Knights Templar Mod" that adds the Knights Templar as a new organization, with its own unique mechanics, missions, and events. The organization system will be designed to be as modular as possible, so new organizations can be added without having to modify the core system.
