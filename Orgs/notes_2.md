The concept of sub-organizations or secret societies can certainly add a new layer of complexity and intrigue to the game, and fits within the concept of layered organizations. Here's a simple approach:

**Primary and Sub-Organizations**: You can structure organizations hierarchically. Each primary organization can have multiple sub-organizations. For example, a Kingdom (primary organization) could have various Ducal Factions (sub-organizations) within it. Each organization level can have its own rules, roles, and mechanics, but should also interact with the level above and below it. For example, a Duke can influence the Kingdom's politics and can be influenced by his own vassals.

**Secret Organizations**: Some organizations, both primary and sub, could be flagged as 'secret'. Members of these organizations would then operate covertly. In the game mechanics, this could translate to secret missions, covert influence over public organizations, hidden alliances, and secret power structures. For example, an Assassin's Guild could be a secret organization operating within a Kingdom. It could have its own internal hierarchy, carry out missions that influence the kingdom's politics, and its members might have public roles as well.

**Visibility and Discovery**: For secret organizations, there should be mechanics to control their visibility and discovery. For example, you could implement a 'suspicion' system that increases the likelihood of discovering secret organizations based on their activities. If a secret organization is discovered, it could face sanctions, or even trigger specific events like witch hunts or purges.

You could also implement a mechanic that allows player characters to create or join secret organizations, giving them new avenues to influence the game world. Such membership could come with risks (being discovered) and rewards (power, influence, unique abilities). 

Organizations in Crusader Kings 3, such as military orders or religious institutions, offer depth to gameplay by providing different paths of influence, power, and resources. They introduce mechanics that shape character actions, relationships, and world events. Taking inspiration from this, all new organizations you plan to add should share the following core features:

1. **Hierarchy/Rank**: All organizations should have some form of hierarchy or rank system to reflect the character's standing within the organization. This will directly impact the influence and resources the character can command.

2. **Tasks/Quests**: Organizations should provide tasks or quests related to their specific functions. For example, a Thieves' Guild could have theft or smuggling missions, while a Scholars' Guild could have research or knowledge-dissemination tasks. 

3. **Resources and Benefits**: Membership in an organization should grant access to specific resources or benefits. This could be as simple as income for a Merchant's Guild, access to certain knowledge for a Scholars' Guild, or the ability to call upon fellow members for aid in the Knights' Order.

4. **Inter-Organization Interaction**: Organizations should have some form of interaction with each other. This could be cooperation, competition, or conflict, depending on the nature of the organizations involved.

5. **Membership Rules**: Each organization should have its own set of requirements or restrictions for membership. Some may be open to anyone willing to join, while others may have stringent entry requirements.

6. **Organization Goals**: Each organization should have its own overarching goal or objective, which shapes its actions and interactions with the world. 

Applying these to the organizations we've discussed (5-20), we can create unique mechanics for each. For example:

- **Mercenary Company**: Characters can hire these companies for warfare or personal protection. The higher a character's rank within the company, the more troops they can command. The company might also offer missions to undertake against rival mercenary groups or specific targets.

- **Scholars' Guild**: Membership can grant characters access to new technologies or policies faster. The guild can offer tasks like deciphering ancient texts, which can result in technological advancements or even the discovery of hidden artifacts.

- **Assassins' Guild**: Members can carry out assassinations for a price. The higher the rank, the higher the profile of the targets they can take on. They can also be hired by other characters to carry out assassinations.

Incorporating these organizations into the game not only provides players with new ways to interact with the world but also adds more layers to the game's existing mechanics.
Remember, these are just ideas. The game's exact mechanics would depend on the details of the game world or mod and the gameplay experience you want to deliver.
